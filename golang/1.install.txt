1 extract into /usr/local

2 add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH

  you can do this by adding this line to ur /etc/profile(for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:
  
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

3 installing to a custom location
  
  the Go binary distributions assume they will be installed in /usr/local/go, but it is possible to install the Go tools to a different location. In this case you must set the GOROOT environment variable to point to the directory in which it was installed.

  For example, if you installed Go to your home directory you should add the following commands to $HOME/.profile:

  export GOROOT=$HOME/go
  export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin

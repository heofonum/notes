1 create folder as the workspace of go

such as:

    1 cd $HOME/go
    2 mkdir bin pkg src
    3 export GOPATH=go
      export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

tips:

    1 src contains Go source files organized into packages(one package per directory)
    2 pkg contains package objects
    3 bin contains executeable commands

    the go tool builds source packages and installs the resulting binaries to the pkg and bin dicectories

    the sec subdirectory typically contains multiple version control repositories(such as Git or Mercurial) that track the development of one or moew souce packages

    example:

        bin/
            hello    # command executable
            outyet   # command executable
        pkg/
            linux_amd64/
                github.com/golang/example/
                    stringutil.a # package object
        src/
            github.com/golang/example/
                .git/               # Git repository metadata
                hello/
                    hello.go        # command source
                outyet/
                    main.go         # command source
                    main_test.go    # test source
                stringutil/
                    reverse.go      # package source
                    reverse_test.go # test source

        this workspace contains one repository(example) comprising two commands(hello and outyet) and one library(stringutil)
